ðŸ’»âœ¨ Excited to share my first task for the Web Development Internship at CodSoft!

For Task 1, I created my personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
This portfolio highlights my skills, projects, and includes my resume & contact details.

Through this task, I learned how to structure a professional website, improve UI design, and build a responsive layout. ðŸš€

I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!
